          <h4>Grade Homework Right in the Book</h4>

          <p>For each assignment you can see all your student
          homeworks on one page. Grading is quick and easy with the
          click of a button to run each submission. You can add a
          grade and comments for your students to view.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Review Quiz Results</h4>

          <p>A part of each book section contains quiz questions.
          As an instructor you can see your class averages for each
          question and look at the answers from individual
          students.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Check Student Progress and Activity</h4>

          <p>Do you wonder what your students are really doing when
          they should be reading and doing homework? You can see
          which students are active, which students are trying
          hard, and which students seem to just get it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Keep your Course up to Date</h4>

          <p>The instructors dashboard will always let you know if there are important updates for your course.  With the press of a button your course can be rebuilt with the latest bug fixes or new content.</p>

          <dt>Register as a user</dt>

          <dd>Begin by registering as a regular user <a href=
          "http://interactivepython.org/runestone/default/user/register">
          Here</a>. When you register, register for the thinkcspy
          course. You will change that in a few steps.</dd>

          <dt>Navigate to the Instructor's Dashboard</dt>

          <dd>The <a href=
          "http://interactivepython.org/runestone/admin/index">Instructors
          Dashboard</a> Has the tools to create a course, update a
          course, grade assignments, and generate other
          reports.  For now, we will use it to create a course.</dd>

          <dt>Create a Custom Course</dt>

          <dd>Click on the Create Course link to go to the course creation page.  there you will enter some important information about your course.</dd>

          <dt>Enter Course Information</dt>

          <dd>You will need a unique name for your course, <code>yourcoursename</code> along
          with the start date, and some other information. The
          unique course name is the name your students will need to
          use to register.</dd>

          <dt>Select a Book</dt>

          <dd>You can use either How to Think Like a Computer
          Scientist, or Problem solving with Algorithms and Data
          structures using Python. Either book may be used as is,
          or you can use our drag and drop interface to mix and
          match chapters from either book.</dd>

          <dt>Submit</dt>

          <dd>In just a few seconds a course will be set up, and a
          book built for you. After a successful build you will be
          registered as an instructor for this course, and you should be at the homepage.  If you get an error check the URL carefully.   It should look like <code>http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/yourcoursename/index.html</code>  the yourcoursename part is important and serves to uniquely idenitfy your course.</dd>

          <p>Yes. All of the important parts of the book are served
          as static pages. Everything else that happens either uses
          Javascript right in the browser, or background ajax calls
          that won&#8217;t have any impact on the primary text. We
          host this on a very reliable service and we monitor our
          traffic constantly. In summer 2013 we increased our
          capacity in anticipation of higher traffic for Fall
          2013.</p>

          <p>There could be two reasons.</p>

          <ol class="arabic simple">
            <li>You only see assignments or quiz questions that
            your students have attempted. If you or your students
            haven&#8217;t attempted any assignments yet then this
            report will be empty.</li>

            <li>Check your course starting date. If the starting
            date is in the future you won&#8217;t see anything. You
            can change your course start date <a class=

          title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>

          <p>You can either just change your course start date, see
          above, or you can rebuild your course. We recommend that
          you rebuild your course every so often to get the latest
          bug fixes etc. Here is the link to <a class=

          rebuild your course</a>.</p>

          <p>All the data from past terms is still saved in the
          database so students that want to go back and look at
          things from their past terms will be able to access their
          information, but nothing prior to your latest course
          start date will show up in any of your reports.</p>

          rebuild your course</a>. We recommend that you do this
          every so often. The instructors page will show you the
          current version of our software used to build the
          thinkcspy and pythonds books. It will also show you the
          version for your own course. If you course is out of date
          you will also get a flash message in the upper right

          <p>We are working on an automatic way to delete a course,

          <p>That would be awesome. This whole book is open source.
          You can grab a copy of the source on <a class=
          "reference external" href=
          "http://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone">github</a>. The
          source for thinkcspy and pythonds is in the source folder
          and there is a subfolder for each chapter. If you want to
          make a whole new chapter then create a folder and follow
          the conventions of one of the other chapters. There is
          full documentation for the markup language at <a class=
          "reference external" href=
          "http://docs.runestoneinteractive.org">docs.runestoneinteractive.org</a>.
          When you are finished make a pull request and we&#8217;ll
          review your material and incorporate them into the

          <p>New exercises are always welcome and we would love to
          expand the number of exercises. The simplest way is to go
          to the <a class="reference external" href=
          "http://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone/issues">github
          issues</a> page and file a new issue. In the description
          simply include the text for the exercise and which
          chapter you think it should go in. We&#8217;ll take it
          from there. After we&#8217;ve added the exercise you can
          rebuild your book and it will be there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id=

          <p>Ok, this is a question that has the potential to start
          nasty religious wars. The technical answer is that this
          book uses a version of Python called <a class=
          "reference external" href="http://skulpt.org">Skulpt</a>.
          It is entirely written in Javascript so that it runs
          right in the browser. We think this is very cool. Now
          some poeple get all crazy about whether they should teach
          Python 3 or Python 2. The truth is that for CS1 and CS2
          it really doesn&#8217;t matter. Skulpt can do print with
          or without parenthesis, and lets face it for CS1 thats
          really all that matters. Sure, there are differences, but
          are you really going to start out by teaching your
          students about <cite>dict_keys</cite> and how they are
          different from a <cite>list</cite>. If so, I think you
          are cruel and you should teach your students APL. If you
          want to slant your teaching toward Python 3, you can do
          that with this book. If you want to lean towards 2, you
          can do that too.</p>
