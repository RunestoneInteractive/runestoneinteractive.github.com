          <h2>A Classroom Example</h2>
          <p>Suppose you wanted to have an example program that you could start class with, and then edit and change during the course of the class.  Here is how you would create a simple page for you and your class to load into the browser and experiment with.</p>

          <pre>
Approximating pi
================

.. activecode:: pi_example1

   terms=input("How many terms do you wish?")
   pi = 0.0
   den = 1
   for counter in range(terms):
       nextterm = (4.0/den)*(-1)**counter
       pi = pi + nextterm
       den = den + 2
   print pi


   def leibniz(terms):
       acc = 0.0
       num = 4.0
       den = 1
       for term in range(terms):
           nextterm = num/den * (-1)**term
           acc = acc + nextterm

           den = den + 2

       return acc

Try running the code above with different values for the
number of terms.  How many terms do you need in order to get
3.14159 for the value of pi?
        </pre>

           <p>After you install the RunestoneTools, as described below.  You can save the example above to a file. When you run the <code>paver build</code> command, you will get an html file that you can load into your browser.  It will look like this:
           	<img src="images/pipage.png" width="100%">
           </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>An in Class Quiz</h2>
Another Scenario might be that you want to have your students take a quick online quiz that looks like this:

          <img src="images/quizpage.png" width="100%">

You can create a quiz using the same simple markup language used in the previous example.

      <dt>Get the Template Project</dt>
      <dd>The quickest way to get up and running is to clone <a href="http://github.com/runestoneinteractive/runestonetools">this repository</a> on github. Or simply download and unzip this <a href="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneTools/releases/tag/1.0b1">zip file</a>.</dd>

      <dt>Install the prerequisites</dt>
        <dd>The <a href="http://github.com/runestoneinteractive/runestonetools"> README</a> File gives a full description of the things you will need to "pip install" to get up and running.  Its easy, and fast. </dd>
      <dt>Edit</dt>
          <dd>The template project has an rst file ready to edit.  You can simply start with file and build up from there.</dd>
      <dt>Build</dt>
          <dd>The <code>paver build</code> command will create a nice looking html file for you in the build directory under the template project.  Once you have built you can preview that file directly in your browser.</dd>
      <dt>Deploy</dt>
          <dd>The README file gives detailed instructions on two different ways to deploy your project.  1.  If you have access to your own web server you can simply drop the build folder in place and go.  2.  You can use Githubs awesome pages feature to host your site.  Once you set it up its as easy as <code>paver deploy</code> to publish your latest class materials.</dd>
