Given the following C program:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main(void) {
     int a = 7;
     int b = 4;

     if (a<=b) { 
       a = 99;
     } else {    
       int t = a;
       a = b;
       b = t;
     }
     return a;                                     
   }

.. fillintheblank:: fitb-ex3

  What value is returned from main? 

  - :4: Correct.
    :7: No, because the variable a is always modified in this program.
    :99: No. Since a is greater than b, the code on line 6 is never executed.
    :x: Sorry, no. What is happening in the else block?
