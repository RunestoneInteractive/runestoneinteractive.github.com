All text in the content area is actually parsed as HTML.
Sphinx markup is interpreted as plain text.
Characters that have special meaning in HTML (``<``, ``>``)
need to be escaped in the directive text (``&lt;``, ``&gt;``)
unless surrounded by whitespace, for example:

.. code-block:: none

   # No space, HTML required
   if x&lt;y:

   # OK as is
   if x > y:

   # No space, HTML required
   ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; x = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

   # OK as is
   ArrayList < Integer > x = new ArrayList < > ();
