Given the following C++ statements:

.. code-block:: cpp

   int  val = 0;
   int& ir  = val;
   auto x   = ir;

What type is x?

.. reveal:: reveal-ex3
   :modal:
   :modaltitle: Understanding auto type deduction

   If you said, ``int``, excellent job!

   ``ir`` is a reference to ``val``, 
   which makes ``ir`` just another name for ``val``. 
   ``auto x = ir;`` is exactly the same as if we had written 
   ``auto x = val;`` here.
